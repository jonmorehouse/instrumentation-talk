## thoughts

* easily identify what is wrong
* SOA 

## Sections 

# the current situation

  - how do we know if this is working?
  - our app went down and what is broken?
  - "check the logs" ... 
  - but I didn't build it?!?
  - but I'm not an engineer!

# What if we ... 

- designed our apps to tell them when they were working (and not working)?
- measured requests instead of CPU,Ram,swap etc etc
- could have dashboards telling us _useful_ information about a system

# So what even is statsd?

- protocol
- Simple daemon for easy stats aggregation
- statistics frontend that is compatible with many different backends

# Data Dog


# A Case Study, distributed-stats-collection

# DataDog and Statsd at BuzzFeed  

Ok - this is pretty awesome, how do I create stats?

`pip install statsd` 

# Opportunities

* we need more graphs!
* dashboards are not only important to engineers
* group ownership and responsibility
